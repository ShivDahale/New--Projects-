                            The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat and
                            the fastest land animal. It has a tawny to creamy
                            white or pale buff fur that is marked with evenly
                            spaced, solid black spots. The head is small and
                            rounded, with a short snout and black tear-like
                            facial streaks. It reaches 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at
                            the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is
                            between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in).
                            Adults weigh between 21 and 72 kg (46 and 159 lb).
                            The cheetah is capable of running at 93 to 104 km/h
                            (58 to 65 mph); it has evolved specialized
                            adaptations for speed, including a light build, long
                            thin legs and a long tail.

                            The cheetah was first described in the late 18th
                            century. Four subspecies are recognised today that
                            are native to Africa and central Iran. An African
                            subspecies was introduced to India in 2022. It is
                            now distributed mainly in small, fragmented
                            populations in northwestern, eastern and southern
                            Africa and central Iran. It lives in a variety of
                            habitats such as savannahs in the Serengeti, arid
                            mountain ranges in the Sahara, and hilly desert
                            terrain.
